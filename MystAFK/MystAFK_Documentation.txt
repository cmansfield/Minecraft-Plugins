MystAFK - v0.1.0 (BETA)
Author: AirsoftingFox

MystAFK plugin is a custom plugin to meet unique AFK player needs. The 
aim of the plugin is prevent players from using AFK machines or macros
to reap server timed rewards. All players who have been logged onto the
server will receive an in-chat prompt asking if they are AFK, if they
do not respond then they will be set to AFK. AFK player cannot send 
commands or chat, they are invisible and cannot perform any actions
whey they are AFK. If they are in an AFK state for too long, then the
server will automatically kick the offending player. 

Commands:
	/afk
		Toggles a player's AFK status
	/NoAFK
		Only used by the chat click event, a randomized key
		is used to prevent players from using this command

Permissions:
	MystAFK.bypassAFK
		This permission is typically used by admins and staff.
		Give this permission to any player you don't want to
		be placed into AFK after a given amount of time.

config.yml:
	PromptTime
		This value indicates the number of seconds after a player 
		has logged on before they receive the "Are you AFK?" chat
		prompt.
	TimeOutTime
		This value is the number of seconds after a player has
		logged into until they will automatically be placed into 
		an AFK state. If the player interacts with the chat prompt
		before then, their timer will be reset.
	KickTimeOut
		This value is the number of seconds before a player is 
		automatically kicked from the server if they do not
		indicate that they are not AFK. 
	MoveResetTimer
		This is a true / false value. When set to true a player's
		movement resets their AFK timer. This will prevent the
		plugin from catching players using AFK macros
